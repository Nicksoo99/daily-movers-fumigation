Google Search Console verification — quick instructions

Options (pick one when adding a new property in Search Console):

1) HTML file (URL-prefix property)
   - In GSC choose "URL prefix" and enter: https://dailymoversfumigation.com
   - Select the "HTML file" verification method and GSC will give you a file named like
     `googleXXXXXXXXXXXX.html` with specific content.
   - Save that exact file (no changes) under this project's `public/` folder so it becomes
     available at:
       https://dailymoversfumigation.com/googleXXXXXXXXXXXX.html
   - Back in GSC click Verify.

2) HTML meta tag (URL-prefix property)
   - In GSC choose "HTML tag" verification. It gives a meta tag like:
       <meta name="google-site-verification" content="XXXXXXXX" />
   - Paste that meta tag into the `<head>` of `index.html` (I can add it for you if you paste the full tag here).
   - Save/deploy, then click Verify in GSC.

3) Domain property (recommended if you control DNS)
   - In GSC choose "Domain" and verify by adding a DNS TXT record to your domain provider:
       Name/Host: @ (or leave blank depending on provider)
       Value: google-site-verification=XXXXXXXX
   - DNS TXT verification covers all subdomains and both http/https but requires access to DNS.

After verification
  - In GSC → Sitemaps: submit `https://dailymoversfumigation.com/sitemap.xml`.
  - Use URL Inspection to request indexing for important pages.

Quick checks you can run locally or after deploy:
  curl -I https://dailymoversfumigation.com/googleXXXXXXXXXXXX.html
  curl -I https://dailymoversfumigation.com/sitemap.xml

If you want, paste the meta tag here and I'll add it to `index.html` for you, or paste the exact HTML file content and filename and I'll write it into `public/`.
