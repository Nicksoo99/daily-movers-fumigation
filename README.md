Notes:
- Mobile menu toggle added. Button is visible on narrow screens.
- If you want the files moved into a different folder (e.g., replace the existing `Movers` file), tell me and I'll move them.
- A gallery has been added that references WhatsApp photos found in the parent `Agesa` folder. If you open `index.html` and the images do not appear, either:
	- Move the desired images into `Daily-Movers/images/` and update the `src` paths accordingly, or
	- Keep the photos in the parent folder (they are currently referenced as `../WhatsApp Image ...jpeg`).

How to add your own photos:

1. Create an `images` folder inside `Daily-Movers`.
2. Copy your image files into `Daily-Movers/images/`.
3. Edit `index.html` gallery image `src` attributes to point to `images/your-file.jpg`.

If you want, I can move selected images into `Daily-Movers/images/` for you.

WhatsApp button

- A floating WhatsApp button has been added to the site. It opens a chat to **+254717629399** using `https://wa.me/254717629399`.

If you'd like the button removed, moved, or changed (different number or style), tell me and I'll update it.
